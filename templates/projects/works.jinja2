<div class="header">
	I worked in different web-studios during 2007-2010 and created<br>
	a lot of designs for websites. Here are some of them:
</div>

<div class="work_info">
	Website for hospital
	<br><a href="http://clinica72.ru">http://clinica72.ru</a>
</div>

<p class="text">
	On this website users can read about hospital services and doctors,
	make an appointment and get a free online consultation. All information is
	structured pretty well, and it is easy for a user to find everything he needs.
</p>

	<br><a href="http://vezitaxi.com">http://vezitaxi.com</a>
</div>

<p class="text">
	Taxi website with tons of useful information about fares, services, news, promotions and online order.
</p>

</div>

<div class="work_info">
	Website for insurance company
	<br><a href="http://osago72.ru">http://osago72.ru</a>
</div>

<p class="text">
	It is a small website with car insurance fare calculator and online consultation with company's agents about process of car insurance.
</p>

<div class="image_std">

	<span>Main page with cars</span>
</div>


<div class="work_info">
	Food portal
	<br><a href="http://poesh.com">http://poesh.com</a>
</div>

<p class="text">
	First startup in my life was built in 2008. Website about food in my own city:
	full list of restaurants, cafes and pubs with complete menus, photos and additional
	info for each. Users can comment existing content, add new (there is user recipes section)
	and vote for their favorite places.
</p>

<div class="image_std">
	<img src="images/4_works/4_poesh.jpg">
	<span>"Poesh" translate from russian like "eat this"</span>
</div>

<p class="text">
	We worked hard to develop this portal but it was hardly possible to actualize all this information for every cafe by a small team of students. So we stopped updating it.

	I also have more than 30 other works in my portfolio. Among them there are websites for construction and furniture companies, online shops, pawnshops, car sales and transport companies, music festivals, factories and electricity holdings.

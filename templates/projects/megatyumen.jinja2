	<span>Redesigned main page with new page structure</span>
</div>

<p class="text">
	There are a lot of different information types on the main page: latest news,
	announcements, interviews, articles, comments and other. It was an interesting and
	hard task to make main layout more usable, responsive and easy-to-changing.
</p>

<p class="text">
	Also there are few subportals which must have exactly the same page structure  with another set of blocks.
	It was a big deal to create dinamic layouts which can be changed so easy.

<p class="text">
	Layouts were designed to be responsive and automatically adjust to the resolution of user's device.
	It is very comfortable to view portal's weather reports, read news our comment something there
	using popular mobile devices (not even Apple)

<p class="text">
	News is one of the most important parts of the portal. I redesigned current news structure
	to make representation of stories more bright and powerful.
